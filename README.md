# atlas_qdpx

Atlas-qdpx is a library to handle QDA-REFI exports from the atlas.ti QDA (Qualitative Data Analysis) software 
written in Python. The QDA-REFI format is a XML-based format that is used to exchange QDA data between different 
software tools. The library provides a tools to extract citations and respective codes for all documents in one or 
more a QDA-REFI files, to enable further analysis of the data.

## Installation

To install the library, you can use pip:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/sereios/atlas_qdpx
```

After pulling the repository, and creating a virtual environment, you can install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

The library provides functions designed to be used in a Jupyter notebook or Python script. Functions operate either on 
a single QDA-REFI file or a directory containing multiple files. The basic functions are `parse_qdpx` and 
`parse_qdpx_dir`, each returning a list of dictionaries with the extracted data containing the following keys:

| Key | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `doc_id` | original id of the document in atlas.ti project (starting at 1) |
| `citation` | original text of the citation |
| `code` | code in the atlas.ti codebook |
| `start` | start position as a string index of the document's text |
| `end` | end position as a string index of the document's text |
| `start_atlas.ti` | original atlas.ti start position, referring to the document's paragraphs (starting at 1) |
| `end_atlas.ti` | original atlas.ti end position, referring to the document's paragraphs (starting at 1) |
| `file` | name of the original plain text file in atlas.ti project |
| `coder` | name or abbreviation of coding researcher as specified by the `coder` parameter |

When calling on a single file, the Coder has to be specified as a parameter. When calling on a directory, the Coder 
is derived from the file name, assuming the files carry a suffix with the coder's name (e.g. `file_coder.qdpx`).

The library also includes three DataFrame functions, based upon the `pandas` library:
1. `annotations_to_df` creates a sorted pandas DataFrame from the list of dictionaries.
2. `extract_code_group_dfs` creates a dictionary of DataFrames, each containing the annotations for a group of codes.
   Code groups have to be passed as a dictionary with the group name as key and a list of codes as values. Codes 
   not included in any group are added to a group named `"misc"`.
3. `save_output_dfs` saves DataFrames to an output directory in CSV format. If a dictionary of code groups is passed, 
   the function saves a CSV file for each code group in addition to the main DataFrame. A project name has to be 
   provided to create file names.

Finally, the library includes two functions wrapping the functionality by directly reading a QDA-REFI file or a 
directory and saving the output to a directory (`project_to_csv`, `folder_to_csv`).

#### Examples

For a single file:
    
```python
from atlas_qdpx import parse_qdpx, annotations_to_df, extract_code_group_dfs, save_output_dfs, project_to_csv

input_file = "path/to/file.qdpx"
coder = "coder_name"

# extract annotations
annoations = parse_qdpx(input_file, coder="coder_name")

# convert to DataFrame
annoations_df = annotations_to_df(annoations)

# extract code group dataframes
code_groups = {"group_name_1": ["code1", "code2"],
               "group_name_2": ["code3", "code4"]}
code_group_dfs = extract_code_group_dfs(annoations_df, code_groups=code_groups)

# save output to csv
output_dir = "path/to/output"
project_name = "project_name"
save_output_dfs(annoations_df, 
                output_path=output_dir,
                project_name=project_name,
                code_groups=code_groups)

# parse directly from file to csv
project_to_csv(input_file, 
               output_path=output_dir, 
               project_name=project_name,
               coder=coder,
               code_groups=code_groups)
```

For a directory of files:

```python
from atlas_qdpx import parse_qdpx_dir, folder_to_csv

input_dir = "path/to/directory"

# extract annotations
annotations = parse_qdpx_dir(input_dir)

# parse directly from directory to csv
code_groups = {"group_name_1": ["code1", "code2"],
               "group_name_2": ["code3", "code4"]}
output_dir = "path/to/output"
project_name = "project_name"

folder_to_csv(input_dir, 
              output_path=output_dir, 
              project_name=project_name,
              code_groups=code_groups)
```

Code group extraction and manual saving to CSV work the same way as for single files, as all annotations are colected 
in a single DataFrame.

### Advanced Usage: Standardization

Additionally, the library allows all basic functions (working upon QDPX files) to accept with an additional 
`standardizer` parameter. This can be used to impose certain modifications on or extract derived attributes from the 
annotations â€“ such as e.g. imposing common boundaries upon citations (i.e. "coding units" following Mayring) or 
mapping code names to a common standard.

Functions accepts any class sharing a common interface defined by the `Standardizer` class in the `standardizer` 
module. These classes have to implement the following methods:

- `preprocess`: Method to preprocess documents to derive necessary information for standardization. As documents are 
  internally handled as a list of dicts, the method has to take this as input and return the same output format.
- `standardize`: Method to implement the desired standardization of annotations. As annotations are internally 
  handled as tuples, the method also has to accept and return a list tuples. Basic tuples are structured as follows
- `(start_index, end_index, code)` and return tuples have to include additional features starting at index 3.

Additionally, standardizers have to carry a `custom_keys` attribute which has to be a dictionary mapping custom keys 
to be included in the returned annotation dicts to the respective index in the tuple.

As an example, the repository includes the `SpacyStandardizer` class, which uses the `spacy` library reconstruct 
full sentences around citations and returns standardized citations and spans based upon groups of consecutive 
complete sentences (as if the coding unit would have been defined as at least one complete sentence). The class is 
for demonstration purposes only and can be used to guide the implementation of custom standardizers.

```python
import spacy

from atlas_qdpx import parse_qdpx
from spacy_standardizer.spacy_standardizer import SpacyStandardizer

input_file = "path/to/file.qdpx"
coder = "coder_name"

# load spacy model
nlp = spacy.load("de_core_news_sm")

# define standardizer (the cutoff parameter is optional and tries to cut off trailing headers sometimes included in 
# spaCy sentences)
standardizer = SpacyStandardizer(nlp, cutoff=True)

# extract annotations
annoations = parse_qdpx(input_file, 
                        coder="coder_name", 
                        standardizer=standardizer)
```
